## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Go installed on your system.

### Windows (Recommended: Latest)

1.  **Download**: Get the latest Go installer from the [official Go website](https://go.dev/dl/).
2.  **Install**: Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3.  **Verify**: Open a new terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and run:
    ```cmd
    go version
    ```

### Linux (Recommended: 1.22.0)

1.  **Download the Archive**:
    ```bash
    wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ```
2.  **Extract the Archive**:
    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ```
3.  **Update PATH**: Add the following line to your `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc`:
    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
    ```
    Then, reload your shell profile: `source ~/.profile`.
4.  **Verify Installation**:
    ```bash
    go version
    ```

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/seaavey/Aemy-go.git
    cd Aemy-go
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash

## Troubleshooting

### Error: `go-sqlite3 requires cgo`

If you encounter the following error, it means the `go-sqlite3` package requires a C compiler, which may be disabled in your Go environment.

```
[Client ERROR] DB error: failed to upgrade database: failed to check if foreign keys are enabled: Binary was compiled with 'CGO_ENABLED=0', go-sqlite3 requires cgo to work. This is a stub
```

#### Linux Solution

Install the necessary build tools:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential gcc
```

#### Windows Solution

You need to install a GCC toolchain, such as [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/). After installation, ensure the MinGW `bin` directory is added to your system's `PATH`.
